## Metric-Imperial Converter

This API converts certain units from the imperial system to the metric system and vice-versa

- Most conversion logic is in the `controllers` folder with a smaller part in `routes/api.js`
- Unit and functional tests were written to test if the API is working properly
- Security features added by using Helmet.js
